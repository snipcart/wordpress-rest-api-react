# Demo: Using WordPress with React to Build a Modern Web App (WP REST API)

![react-woprdress](https://snipcart.com/media/204844/wordpress-react.png)

WordPress REST API is a huge step forward for frontend developers looking to combine the power of JavaScript frameworks like React (or [Vue.js](https://snipcart.com/blog/wordpress-vue-headless)) with WordPress.

This is exactly what we did with this demo of the WordPress REST API in the work. 

We use WordPress as a backend, and the REST API to feed data into a React app.

More precisely, you’ll learn:

- How to access the WP REST API from your frontend
- How to add a custom post type and expose it to the API
- How to handle React Hooks (and create a custom one)
- How to build a React app backed by this API
